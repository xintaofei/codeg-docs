description: The Collaboration settings screen — whether an agent may hand work to another agent, how deep the chain may go, what each worker is spawned with, and the switches that decide which codeg-mcp tools your agents get inside a conversation — live feedback, ask-a-question, session lookup, reading and driving the built-in browser, and creating automations and to-dos from chat.

# Collaboration

**Settings → Collaboration** is where you decide how much of Codeg an agent may reach **beyond its own conversation** — *"How agents work with each other, and which of Codeg's own tools they can reach from inside a conversation."* Two panels:

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration** — whether an agent may hand a sub-task to another agent at all, how deep a chain may recurse, and what each agent is spawned with as a worker.
- **In-conversation tools** — the tool groups Codeg injects when an agent starts: feedback, ask-a-question, session lookup, the built-in browser, and the create-from-chat writers.

They sit on one page because the same [`codeg-mcp` companion](/reference/architecture) injects both when an agent starts, and deciding one without seeing the other never made much sense. Each panel carries **its own Save** button, and nothing in either takes effect until you press it.

::: info New in 0.31.2
Both panels used to live at the bottom of **Settings → General**, which is how that screen grew to twice the length its name implies. They moved here, to their own entry between **Skill Packs** and **Agents**, in **0.31.2**. Nothing about what they do changed with the move.

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

The switch that lets an active agent hand sub-tasks to other agents — Codeg's **delegation** feature. Two tabs:

- **General** — **Enable delegation** (off by default; when off, the `delegate_to_agent` tool is hidden from the agent's tool catalog), **Maximum delegation depth** (1–8, default **1** — how deep a chain of agents-spawning-agents may recurse), and **Completed-result cache (MB)** (default 512 — how much finished sub-agent output is held in memory while the lead session runs; `0` = unlimited).
- **Agent defaults** — per-agent overrides (mode and config) applied when a delegation call spawns that agent as a worker. The tabs are built from the live agent registry, so a [custom agent](/guide/custom-agents) gets one too, and the options come from a live probe of each agent — what you pick is exactly what it will accept.

Press **Save** to apply. This panel is the control surface; the how-to — writing delegation prompts, watching the team, turning a workflow into a skill — lives in **[Working with Multiple Agents](/guide/multi-agent)**.

One thing switched on here can still be withheld elsewhere, so the panel says so: a warning under **Enable delegation** **names any agent whose per-agent [Let the agent handle files and commands](/guide/agents#let-the-agent-handle-its-own-files-and-commands) switch is on**, because that switch takes the delegation tools away deliberately. The list is read from the policy the backend actually resolved, not guessed from the agent's environment — so it agrees with what the agent will really be handed.

::: info The target list follows your enable toggles
`delegate_to_agent` advertises only the agents you can actually launch, re-read each time an agent starts: a built-in you've disabled in **Settings → Agents** is struck from its list of targets, an enabled custom agent is added to it, and a disabled one is simply never offered. So switching an agent off hides it from the lead as well as from the composer picker.

## In-conversation tools

One card, seven switches, one **Save** — *"extra tools Codeg gives an agent inside a conversation. Each is injected when the agent starts, so a change applies to agents started afterwards."*

| Switch | Default | What the agent gains |
| ------ | ------- | -------------------- |
| **Live Feedback** | Off | Take notes and corrections from you *while it's working* — see below |
| **Ask user question** | On | Pause and put a multiple-choice question to you, rendered as a card above the conversation input. The agent blocks until you answer or skip. Since **0.31.0** the card [collapses to its header](/guide/workspace#follow-along-—-the-conversation) while the question stays pending |
| **Get session info** | On | Resolve a session you referenced — a badge like `codeg://session/<id>` — into its title, agent, status, workspace, token usage, and recent messages. Read-only |
| **Read and drive the built-in browser** | Off | List the pages open in the [built-in browser](/guide/browser#let-an-agent-work-on-the-page), read the ones you shared, act on the ones you shared for acting, and open, point or close tabs |
| **Run code in the built-in browser** | Off | Run its own JavaScript on a page you shared for acting. Needs the switch above — and since **0.31.1** *this* switch is where the decision is made: with it on, snippets run **without asking** unless you set [Running code on a page](/reference/settings/browser#running-code-on-a-page) to *Ask me every time* |
| **Create automations** | Off | Save the conversation as an [automation](/guide/automations) that runs on a schedule |
| **Create to-do tasks** | Off | Queue a card on the [to-do board](/guide/tasks) from the conversation |

The first three are read-only or ask-only. **The other four reach outside the conversation** — two into a page you are looking at, two into app state — which is why they all start off and why they're checked again at the moment the tool is called, not only when the agent started: switching one off stops even a session that is already running from using it.

The two browser switches only ever hand a tool to an agent in the **desktop app**; a browser session has no native tabs for an agent to reach, so the rows are inert there. Be clear about what turning the first one on does, though: with **Default sharing level** at its shipped value of *Read and act*, every page in every browser tab is shared with that agent as it loads. A tab's own control still overrides it page by page, and *Share nothing* leaves every share to that control. → [Let an agent work on the page](/guide/browser#let-an-agent-work-on-the-page)

**Ask user question** no longer costs you two dialogs. Under a permission mode that consults you before *every* MCP tool call — Claude Code's default — the real question card used to be preceded by a raw "run this tool?" approval that dumped the questions as JSON. Since **0.31.0** Codeg recognises its own ask tool and answers that one for you, for that turn only.

**Get session info** spells out to the agent what a session badge *means*: mentioning a session is you pointing at it deliberately, so the agent looks it up without being asked to, once per session mentioned. That mirrors how an `@agent` mention is treated as an instruction to delegate. → [Pick up where another session left off](/guide/multi-agent#pick-up-where-another-session-left-off)

### How live feedback reaches a running agent

There are two channels, and which one you get depends on the agent. The wording you see changes with it, deliberately, because they promise different things:

- **Pushed straight into the turn** — *Insert into current turn*. With an agent whose adapter supports instant steering, your note goes into the work already in flight and the agent sees it right away. That is **Claude Code on adapter 0.65.0 or newer**, and the floor is checked against the adapter actually running rather than the version Codeg would have installed — launch prefers a copy already on your `PATH`, so the pin alone wouldn't prove it.
- **Pulled by the agent** — *Send note for next check*. Any other session whose agent was handed the `check_user_feedback` tool **when it launched** — so not one that can't take MCP at all, and not one you switched this on for mid-session. Having the tool, the agent still has to volunteer a call to it, and those agents typically only check when you mention it: add something like *"check my live feedback regularly"* to your prompt.

A pulled note simply **waits** for the agent's next check. What gets rerouted is a note that couldn't be recorded at all — the turn ended while you were submitting — which is **queued instead, and sent with the next turn**, with Codeg saying so. Attachments follow the same principle from the other side: on the push channel a draft carrying **images and file references travels whole**, and on the pull channel it travels whole too, but by taking the queue rather than being stripped down to its text.

Since **0.30.3** the same two channels drive the composer's **mid-turn send** — the split Send button that appears while the agent is working — so the note doesn't have to go through the **+** menu's dialog. → [Talk to an agent mid-turn](/guide/workspace#talk-to-an-agent-mid-turn)

## Good to know

- **Two Saves, not one.** The delegation panel and the in-conversation-tools card each apply on their own button. Nothing on this screen takes effect as you flip it.
- **Tool switches apply the next time an agent starts.** Each adds or removes a tool "for agents started after this is turned on" — an agent that's connected right now won't gain or lose the capability mid-flight. It needn't be a brand-new conversation, though: any conversation picks the change up whenever its agent next launches, including an existing one you return to after its connection ended. A new conversation is simply the surest way. (The two *create* switches and the two *browser* switches are the exception, and are re-checked at call time — turning one off stops a session that is already running.)
- **These are the codeg-mcp tools.** Delegation and all seven in-conversation tools are served by the [`codeg-mcp` companion](/reference/architecture); the switches here decide which appear in each agent's catalog. Not *every* companion tool is governed here, though — an agent running a [to-do](/guide/tasks) also gets `task_progress` and `task_complete`, injected by the task engine rather than by anything on this screen.
- **An agent that refuses MCP gets none of them.** A [custom agent](/guide/custom-agents) with its **MCP support** switch turned off is connected without the companion at all, so nothing on this screen reaches it.
- **The status bar carries these same switches.** All eight of them: the [codeg-mcp popover](/guide/multi-agent#the-service-from-the-status-bar) has delegation and every in-conversation tool, and its **open settings** link lands on this page. Flip one there with this page open and the form converges on it rather than sending its stale value back on the next Save.
