# Appearance

**Settings → Appearance** controls how Codeg looks: light or dark, the accent color, your own colors on top of it, how large everything is drawn, the fonts used across each surface, an optional background image, and a couple of extras. It's the screen Settings opens on, and every change here saves automatically and applies immediately — no save button, no restart. (One exception: the custom-CSS editor previews live and saves on **Apply**.)

## Theme mode

A single picker — **Follow system**, **Light**, or **Dark**. *Follow system* tracks your OS setting and flips when it does; the line beneath shows the *effective* theme it resolved to right now. On the desktop app, the native window switches with it.

## Theme color

The accent palette used for buttons, accents, and highlights. Twelve presets — the standard shadcn theme colors, each a swatch you click:

**Neutral** *(default)* · Zinc · Slate · Stone · Gray · Red · Rose · Orange · Green · Blue · Yellow · Violet

The choice recolors the whole app instantly. The first five — **Neutral** *(default)*, Zinc, Slate, Stone, and Gray — keep every surface gray; the seven **accent** colors (Red, Rose, Orange, Green, Blue, Yellow, Violet) go further, tinting panels, the sidebar, the canvas, and even the code-editor background with that hue. It's automatic — there's no separate toggle.

## Custom Style

The twelve presets are a starting point, not a ceiling. **Custom Style** — collapsed by default, with a one-line summary of what it's currently doing (*Preset defaults*, *3 overrides*, *Custom CSS*, or *Suspended*) — lets you change any color in the app, round every corner, and, if you insist, write raw CSS.

Overrides **sit on top of the base preset** rather than replacing it, so switching preset later keeps them.

### Colors and corners

**Enable custom colors** opens the palette: **31 semantic color tokens**, the same set shadcn documents. Seven are up front — *primary*, *primary foreground*, *background*, *foreground*, *accent*, *border*, *sidebar* — chosen because they're visible the moment you change them and hard to break anything with; the other **24 sit under Advanced** (cards, popovers, muted and secondary surfaces, destructive, input, ring, the five chart colors, and the sidebar's own set).

Two things to know about how you edit them:

- **Light and dark are separate.** You're editing the values for whichever mode the app is in right now, and the panel says so — *"Editing light mode values. Switch the app to dark mode to set its own."*
- **Every field can be given back.** A **reset** control beside a token you've changed returns it to the preset's value; **Clear overrides** does the lot.

**Corner radius** is one slider, and it drives the whole scale from `sm` to `4xl` — so a single drag takes the app from sharp to fully rounded without touching anything else.

### Take a theme with you

Your colors are stored in shadcn's `registry:theme` shape, which makes them portable in both directions:

- **Copy theme JSON** puts the current light/dark pair on the clipboard.
- **Import theme…** accepts a `registry:theme` item, a bare `light`/`dark` object, or a flat token map — so a theme from tweakcn, the shadcn registry, or a colleague pastes straight in. **Read clipboard** fills the box for you.

An exported theme installs into any shadcn project with `shadcn add`, and any shadcn theme works here. Nothing about the format is Codeg-specific.

### Custom CSS *(advanced)*

For what the fields can't reach, **Enable custom CSS** opens an editor that applies to **every Codeg window**. The dialog previews live and saves on **Apply**; it shows how much of its **64 KB** budget you've used and how many rules it parsed, so a stylesheet that silently failed to parse says so instead of just doing nothing.

Two things get flagged, and only one of them is removed:

- **`@import` rules are stripped** — they would fetch a remote stylesheet. One that survives removal through escaped syntax blocks the save entirely rather than being let through.
- **A remote `url()` is called out but kept.** It's your stylesheet, so Codeg doesn't rewrite it — it just makes sure you know that applying it makes a network request. → [Privacy & Security](/reference/privacy)

Your color overrides are available inside it as ordinary variables — `var(--primary)`, `var(--background)`, and so on.

::: warning Two ways out if you break the interface
Custom CSS overrides every built-in style, which means it can genuinely make the app unusable — a `display: none` in the wrong place and there's nothing left to click. So there are two escape hatches that don't depend on the interface working:

- **⌘⌥⇧S** *(Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S)* suspends all custom style — colors and CSS both — and the same keys bring it back. It's a deliberately awkward three-modifier combination, listened for ahead of everything else. → [Shortcuts](/reference/settings/shortcuts)
- **`?safeStyle=1`** on the window's URL opens **that one window** with custom style ignored, leaving your other windows alone.

While either is in effect the section says so and offers **Resume custom style**.
:::

## Window zoom

Scales the entire interface — text, controls, and spacing alike — in discrete steps:

**80% · 90% · 100%** *(default)* **· 110% · 125% · 150%**

Zoom is stored **per device**, so a large external monitor and a laptop screen can each keep their own comfortable size.

## Fonts

Three independent typefaces, one per surface. Each picks from a set of bundled families (grouped **Sans-serif** / **Monospace**) or **Custom…**, which lets you name any font installed on your system. Bundled fonts load only when selected. What you can set differs by surface:

| Surface | Font list | Size | Ligatures | Word wrap |
| ------- | --------- | ---- | --------- | --------- |
| **Interface** | Sans + monospace | — | — | — |
| **Editor** | Monospace | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Terminal** | Monospace | ✓ | ✓ | — |

- **Ligatures** turn on programming ligatures (`=>`, `!=`, `>=`) for fonts that carry them; the toggle disables itself and says so for a font that doesn't. Terminal ligatures apply only to the bundled coding fonts.
- A **live preview** at the bottom renders a line of interface text, a snippet of code, and a terminal command in your current choices — so you can compare before committing.

The editor and terminal these style are the ones in [the workspace](/guide/workspace).

## Workspace background

Put a picture behind the whole workspace. Turn on **Enable background image** and pick an image (**PNG, JPEG, or WebP**, up to **16 MB**); the sidebar, panels, and tab bars turn translucent and **frosted** so the image shows through, while a mask keeps text readable. One image is shared by light and dark mode.

The controls, top to bottom:

| Control | What it does | Default |
| ------- | ------------ | ------- |
| **Enable background image** | The on/off switch for the whole feature | Off |
| **Image** | Choose, replace, or remove the picture | — |
| **Fill mode** | How the image sits: **Cover**, **Contain**, **Center**, or **Tile** | Cover |
| **Mask opacity** | Fades the image toward the theme background — higher gives text more contrast (up to 99%) | 82% |
| **Image blur** | Softens the image, 0–24 px | 0 px |
| **Panel opacity** | How solid the sidebar, panels, and tab bars are — lower lets more image through, all the way to fully transparent | 30% |

::: tip It travels to the browser too
The image is saved on disk with Codeg's data, so a background you set on the desktop also shows when you open the same install as a [server](/getting-started/deployment) in a browser. The display settings (opacity, blur, fill) are stored per device, like zoom.
:::

## Mode selection area

One switch — **Show on the new conversation page**. It controls whether the **Code Development / Office Work** shortcut cards appear above the composer when you open a fresh conversation. Leave it on for one-click access to the welcome quick actions — they seed a starter prompt for the [Office](/guide/office) and [Research](/guide/research) skills, among others — or turn it off for a bare composer.

## Desktop Pet

A collapsible manager for **floating desktop companions** — animated sprite characters that sit on your screen and double as a live status indicator, showing how many agent sessions are running, awaiting approval, or errored. It's collapsed by default; the number beside its title is how many pets you have.

Three ways to add one:

- **Add pet** — supply your own sprite sheet: a **1536×1872 PNG or WebP with transparency** (Codex-compatible), plus an id and a display name.
- **Import from Codex** — pulls in any pets already installed under `~/.codex/pets/`; disabled when there are none.
- **Pet marketplace** — browse and install community pets, filterable by kind (object, animal, person, creature) and sortable by latest, popular, or most-viewed.

Each pet card lets you **Set active**, **Edit**, or **Delete** it (the active pet can't be deleted), and clicking it previews the animations — idle, run, wave, jump, and the session-state poses. **Summon pet window** floats the active pet on your desktop.

::: info The floating pet is desktop-only
Summoning the on-screen companion needs the native desktop window, so **Summon** appears only in the desktop app. You can still build and manage your pet library from a [browser session](/getting-started/deployment) — there's just nowhere for it to float.

## Good to know

- **Appearance is local.** These are per-machine preferences — zoom explicitly so — not part of any synced profile. Set them once on each device.
- **App language isn't here.** Interface language lives on the [System](/reference/settings/system) screen, not Appearance.
- **Almost everything is instant.** No control here needs a reconnect or a restart; the only thing that waits on a button is the custom-CSS editor, which previews live and saves on **Apply**.
- **Custom style travels with the device, not the profile.** Your color overrides and CSS live in the browser or app you set them in — like zoom, and unlike the background image, whose file is stored with Codeg's data.
